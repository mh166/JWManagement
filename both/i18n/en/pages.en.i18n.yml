For bigger projects including multiple congregations it can be the name of the city where the project will be carried out. If the project does not organize cart witnessing, the name can also reflect what will be organized with this project.

    helpText: <p>Every shift has to be assigned a tag. Furthermore every user can be permitted or denied permission to be able to see shifts depending on the tags.</p><p>Tags can reflect different activities (e.g. Cart witnessing, Information stand, Street work, etc.). The dividing of shifts into different tags can be useful, for example if there are multiple shifts at the same time or if only certain publishers are trained in a specific type of public witnessing.</p><p>With every tag there can be a set of template weeks which have been defined previously. By using the automatic option when scheduling, the program can use these template weeks. This saves the project manager or shift manager time when scheduling.</p>

This can be useful, as when the route or location of the teams are so far apart that a common meeting would be too time consuming. Meeting points are defined with coordinates.
